### Learn R to build tools that create stories with data to share.
 I will add content slowly while learning R using Datacamp and statistics following Khan. I am not the sole creator of the content you see on this site. I will do my upmost due diligence to specific where the content is from and share with you the proper credits where credit is due. If I am not perfect and mistakes are made, please don't hesitate to point it out.
