This is the space where I learn the use of data with R. I am going to work on projects that would allow me to generate insights, stories, and new perspectives. Along the way, I will learn so much more than R such as the following features used on the site:
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
[R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
[Blogdown](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/)
[Theme: Creative portfolio](https://github.com/kishaningithub")
